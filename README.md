# JavaScript Challenge

With the coronavirus spreading around the world, people are worried and freaking out by doing crazy things like emptying out grocery stores, hoarding toilet paper (spoiler alert: [you really don't need that much](https://howmuchtoiletpaper.com/)), and practicing crazy ideas like social distancing. As a result of this madness, people want answers. One not so far fetched theory is that the virus came from space.

So, using my awesome JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3 skills, I have created a website that allows you to easily and quickly look up information about all the reported UFO sightings in the US and in Canada.

There are two sites available that I have put together:

- [Date Search](https://philipstubbs13.github.io/javascript-challenge/UFO-level-1/index.html)
  - This site allows you to do a quick search for UFO sightings and filter those search results by a specific date a UFO sighting was reported.
  - The code for this site is available in the [UFO-level-1](./UFO-level-1) folder of this repository.
  - This site is deployed to GitHub pages.
- [Multiple Search Categories](https://philipstubbs13.github.io/javascript-challenge/UFO-level-2/index.html)
  - This site includes all the functionality of the first site, but in addition, this site allows you to set multiple filters and do a more advanced search on specific criteria, including date, city, state, country, and shape.
  - The code for this site is available in the [UFO-level-2](./UFO-level-2) folder of this repository.
  - This site is deployed to GitHub pages.
